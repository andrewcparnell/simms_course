In preparation for the course please install the following, preferably in the below suggested order. Make sure you run these before you arrive in case of poor (or crowded!) internet.

Remember you will need to bring your own personal computer for the duration of the course.

### Step 1

Install the following using the corresponding links

-	R: [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)

-	Rstudio (optional but recommended): [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)

-	JAGS: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/

### Step 2

Now install the following packages by going into Rstudio (or R) and typing:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('rjags','rstan'))
```

Note: this might take a while as these are pretty big and complicated packages.
