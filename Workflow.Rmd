## I am interested in quantifying the __diet/consumption__ of my organisms 

You will need source and consumer isotope data (and optionally discrimination factors and concentration dependence). 

If you have no extra covariates then you should start with __simmr__. If you have extra covariates or raw source data then you should start with __MixSIAR__. If you have no trophic discrimination factors you should start with __SIDER__ and then move to __simmr__ or __MixSIAR__. 

## I am interested in quantifying the __niche behaviour__ of my organisms. 

You will need consumer isotope data only and you should start with __SIBER__.
