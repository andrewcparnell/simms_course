## Learning outcomes
- Run MixSIAR on one of the standard examples
- Check convergence and produce plots in MixSIAR
- Be able to understand output from MixSIAR

## Intro to MixSIAR

- MixSIAR implements a version of the CLR jags code already shown, and through this allows the introduction of random effects and covariates
- It's a bit limited in that:

    1. It's recommended to work with a GUI
    2. You can only put a certain number of random effects/covariates into the model
    3. It doesn't currently take account of uncertainty in TEFs (it calls this _discrimination_)
    4. It doesn't allow for much choice in prior distributions

- However, it's a great start at finding simple ways to run more complicated models

## Running the Wolves example

- In the MixSIAR folder there are three files: `wolves_consumer.csv`, `wolves_dicrimination.csv`, and `wolves_sources.csv`
- These contain the consumer isotope data with two covariates, the discrimination data (no standard deviations), and the source data (for each different region)
- Note that MixSIAR allows you to input either the sources means/sds (as we have been using), or the raw source data, to which it fits a model to estimate the source parameters
- These data are similar to those used in the Semmens _et al_ PLoS ONE paper already mentioned. The methods are more fully described in that paper
- The variables pack and region here are included as _nested_ random effects, meaning that there are two layers of random effects which measure variability between regions and variability between packs. The overall residual measures variability within pack

## Wolves example - running

- First run the model as a test go, then choose a normal run
- These models are starting to get complicated, they take a while to run 
- MixSIAR write JAGS code on the fly. Check out the JAGS model structure in `MixSIAR_model.txt`
- When it's finished click on `process output` to get at the (many) results
- You can also access an R script version of this (much better) in `mixsiar_script.r`

## Analysing output

- First, check convergence using Brooks-Gelman-Rubin or Geweke (both previously covered)
- You then have access to histograms of the posterior distributions of the overall means, and also for each level of the hierarchy; here pack and region
- They also produce a pairs plot (like the matrix plot of yesterday) which can tell you about model inadequacy
- Use the `mixsiar_script.r` if you want full access to the JAGS output for any further analysis

## MixSIAR output - overall proportion densities

## MixSIAR output - matrix plot

## Summary

- We now know how to load in special types of consumers, sources, and discrimination factors in MixSIAR
- We have run one of the more complicated MixSIAR examples
