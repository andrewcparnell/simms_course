# Stable Isotope Mixing Models course - changes to AP notes 

Changes to make:

 - Remove the section on GLMs in the reg_and_simms part
 - Fix plot on slide 4 of siar_stats to have the axes the correct way round (or swap this for a new lecture simmr_stats)
 - Swap fitting and convergence in reg_and_simms
